# Daily Mood Logger with Encouragement Tracker

This repository is a collaboration platform for AAiT 2nd Semester freshman students of section 10 (group 21). This collaboration is aimed at creating a daily mood logger with encouragement tracker python program. The aim of this project is to allow the collaborators to implement what they have learned in computer programming class.

## Project Description

**Daily Mood Logger with Encouragement Tracker** is a simple terminal-based Python program designed to help users track their daily moods and receive a kind or motivational message in return. 

The program asks the user to enter their mood for the day (using a basic scale like 1–5) by asking a set of questions and allows them to add a short note. Based on their input, the program responds with a positive or supportive message. The mood entries are stored in a Python list or dictionary during the session, and users can view all the moods they’ve entered so far.

This project demonstrates our understanding of the basic Python concepts we've learned, including variables, functions, strings, lists, dictionaries, user input, and conditional statements.


## How to Setup and Run the Program

### Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your computer

### Instructions
1. Download the "Mood_Logger" folder from the repository.
2. Open VS-Code or any python terminal environment and open the folder in that environment/platform.
3. Run the main.py file.
4. Follow the instructions to log in a new mood or view your mood history etc.
5. Enjoy the program!

## Main Features

1. Log Your Mood: Enter your daily mood on a scale from 1 to 5 by answering tailored questions.
2. Receive Encouragement: Get a friendly or motivational message based on your mood.
3. View Mood History: See a list of all the moods you've entered so far (during the current session).
4. Simple to Use - Clear and easy-to-understand user prompts.
5. Track Days Logged – Keeps count of how many days/moods you’ve logged.
6. Exit Option – Exit the program anytime with a simple menu choice.
7. Mood Summary – See your average mood score during the session.
8. Edit Entry – Update a previously logged mood or note.
9. Reset History – Clear all entries if you want to start fresh. 

All of these features use beginner Python tools such as:
- Variables
- Lists and dictionaries
- Strings and formatting
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- input() and print()
- Imorting database libraries
- Linking a database to the main python file (A bit advanced but this adds a learning element to this project).
