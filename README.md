# CP_Section10_Group_21_Python_Project

This repository is a collaboration platform for AAiT 2nd Semester freshman students of section 10 (group 21). This collaboration is aimed at creating a daily mood logger with encouragement tracker python program. The aim of this project is to allow the collaborators to implement what they have learned in computer programming class.

# Daily Mood Logger with Encouragement Tracker

## Project Description

**Daily Mood Logger with Encouragement Tracker** is a simple terminal-based Python program designed to help users track their daily moods and receive a kind or motivational message in return. 

The program asks the user to enter their mood for the day (using a basic scale like 1–5) by asking a set of questions and allows them to add a short note. Based on their input, the program responds with a positive or supportive message. The mood entries are stored in a Python list or dictionary during the session, and users can view all the moods they’ve entered so far.

This project demonstrates our understanding of the basic Python concepts we've learned, including variables, functions, strings, lists, dictionaries, user input, and conditional statements.


## How to Setup and Run the Program

### Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your computer

### Instructions
1. Clone or download the project from GitHub Example:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-mood-logger.git
   cd daily-mood-logger
2. Run the python file Example:
    ```bash
   python mood_logger.py

## Main Features

1. Log Your Mood: Enter your daily mood on a scale from 1 to 5 by answering tailored questions.
2. Receive Encouragement: Get a friendly or motivational message based on your mood.
3. View Mood History: See a list of all the moods you've entered so far (during the current session).
4. Simple to Use - Clear and easy-to-understand user prompts.

All of these features use beginner Python tools such as:
- Variables

- Strings and formatting
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- input() and print()
